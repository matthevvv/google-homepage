This is a project I am completing as I am learning how to code in HTML. My goal is to clone the elements on the Google homepage.

I have completed the main section of the page, complete with the styling and hover actions. I spent a lot of time replicating the resizing behavior, but ended up using a couple of @media queries to do so.
